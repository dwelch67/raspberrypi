See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the older pi1 boards, the A, the B, the B rev 2.
But not the A+ nor B+ there are other directories for that.

The raspberry pi family is more similar than different, but I have
decided it is easier to manage by grouping the examples by board type.

My preferred way to run examples is to use my bootloader07 kernel.img on
the board with an ftdi usb to uart board or cable.  I also solder a
momentary pushbutton on the RUN pins, which is basically a board reset.
There are ways to do this without soldering, pins you can push in rather
than solder.

Once the sd card is in with bootloader07, press reset, download the
intel hex (.hex) version of the program I want to run. Press 'g' to go.
Repeat as necessary.

Or you can copy the blinker01.bin file to the kernel.img file on your
sd card, replace the sd card and turn the power on.
