See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

These examples are for the pi zero, see other directories for other
flavors of raspberry pi.  The raspberry pi family is more similar than
different, but I have decided it is easier to manage by grouping the
examples by board type.

The pi zero is similar to the original pi but overclocked and they
removed much of the stuff on the board to get things to make it smaller
and significantly lower cost.  I think this was a direct response to the
getchip.com product.  I wonder if they will actually continue production.

My preferred way to run examples is to use my bootloader07 kernel.img on
the board with an ftdi usb to uart board or cable.  I also solder a
momentary pushbutton on the RUN pins, which is basically a board reset.
There are ways to do this without soldering, pins you can push in rather
than solder.

Once the sd card is in with bootloader07, press reset, download the
intel hex (.hex) version of the program I want to run. Press 'g' to go.
Repeat as necessary.

Or you can copy the blinker01.bin file to the kernel.img file on your
sd card, replace the sd card and turn the power on.
