See the top level README for information on where to find documentation
for the raspberry pi and the ARM processor inside.  Also find information
on how to load and run these programs.

This example is for the pi zero, see other directories for other flavors
of raspberry pi.

This example demonstrates ARM MMU basics.

You will need the ARM ARM (ARM Architectural Reference Manual) for
ARMv5.  I have a couple of pages included in this repo, but you still
will need the ARM ARM.

So what an MMU does or at least what an MMU does for us is it
translates virtual addresses into physical addresses as well as
checking access permissions, and gives us control over cachable
regions.

What does all of that mean?

Well lets go back a little. If you are old enough to have a desktop
computer then a CPU to you may not or may have meant the big box that
you plugged the monitor, keyboard, and mouse into.  And that isnt
all that incorrect.  But when we get into understanding things at
this level, bare metal, we have to dig way deeper.

I currently use processor core or ARM core or some such terms.  You
have to separate the notion of the system and break it into smaller
parts.  There is a processor core, that somehow magically gets our
instructions, it executes them which means from time to time it does
memory bus accesses to talk to the things that our instructions have
told it to do.  We the programmer know the addresses for things the
processor is very stupid in that respect, it knows basically nothing.

Now the processor has a bus (or busses sometimes), a bunch of signals,
address, data in, data out, and control signals to indicate reads from
writes and so on.  That bus is for this discussion is connected to the
mmu, and there is a similar if not identical one on the other side,
but everything we want to say to the outside world we say through
the mmu.  When the mmu is not doing its thing, it just passes those
requests right on through unmodified.   This example has to do with
what happens when you enable the mmu.

So for this discussion lets say the processor side of the mmu addresses
are called virtual addresses and the world side (memory, perpherals
(uart, gpio, etc), and almost everything else) are physical addresses.
One job of the mmu is to translate from virtual to physical.

You may have used tools in your toolchain other than the compiler and
may have realized that programs you compile to run on top of the
operating system you use on your computer are all compiled to run at
the same address.  How is that possible and have them run "at the same
time"?  Well the reality is that none of them are running at that
address.  You might have two programs both compiled to run at address
0x8000, but the reality is thanks to the mmu and the operating system
managing resources, program A may actually be running at 0x10008000 and
program B at 0x20008000, no conflict at all.  When program A accesses
what it thinks is address 0xABCDE it is really talking 0x100ABCDE,
likewise if program B accesses 0xABCDE it is really 0x200ABCDE.
The 0x8000 or 0xABCDE addresses are virtual, that is what the program
thinks it is talking to, the 0x10008000 or 0x20008000 addresses are
physical, that is what we are really talking to or at least that is
what the MMU thinks it is talking to <grin>.  We already know by this
point that there is another magic address translation in the raspberry
pi.  The Broadcom documents talk about peripherals being at some address
0x7Fxxxxxx, but depending on which pi we have we have to access 0x20xxxxxx
or 0x3Fxxxxxx from the ARMs perspective.  And that is not atypical but
also not as obvious.  Take any of the peripherals for example we may
have to have some 0x20ABCDEF address for something but when we push
down into the logic of that peripheral many of those address bits
go away and we may be left with 0xEF or 0xF or 0x3, no reason to carry
about extra address bits in the logic if you only have a few registers.

So for this discussion the processor and our programs operate using
virtual addresses.  The mmu turns those into physical addresses.  When
the mmu is disabled then physical = virtual.  And when it is on there
is no reason we cannot make physical = virtual if we want, and we will
for most of this.  Not making an operating system here just
demonstrating some basics.

Checking access permissions, what does that mean.  Well remember our
two programs one at 0x10008000 and the other at 0x20008000.  Well if
one program is smart enough what is to keep it from accessing the
other programs memory?  Let us start with thinking single core
processors which the ARM11 on this chip is.  We now live in a world
where even our phones have 4 or 8 processor cores working together.
The idea translates from single to multiple.  With any one of these
single cores, the operating system gives each program a little slice
of time.  Then usually an interrupt happens either based on time or
based on some other event and the operating system says it is time
for someone else to use the processor for a while.  The operating
system has to do a little mmu swizzling to say switch 0x8000 to point
at 0x10008000 instead of 0x20008000, but it also changes the virtual
id (or whatever term your processor uses) for the code it is about to
allow to run (remember the operating system is code itself and runs
in an address space with permissions as well).  The mmu tables not
only operate on converting virtual addresses to physical but they
also are or can be set to allow or dis-allow virtual ids.  How exactly
varies widely from one processor family to another, one mmu to another
(ARM vs x86, vs mips, etc).  But if you want to have a computer that
is not trivial to hack by having one program run around where it isnt
supposed to you have to have this layer of protection.  And we will
see that, initially we will just allow everyone or at least us full
access.

Control over cachable regions.  That gets into what is a cache in this
context.  Well memory is expensive, it takes a lot of transistors, we
have two basic volatile types SRAM and DRAM.  SRAM when you set one
bit to a value a one or a zero, so long as the power stays on it
remembers that value.  DRAM is more like a rechargeable battery, it
drains over time, if you want it to remember a zero, no problem (just
run with this simplification if you actually know how they work) if
you want it to remember a one though, you have to keep reminding it
that it is a one by charging it back up, if you forget to charge it
back up it will drain to a zero.  We dont actually have to do this
there is logic that does this refresh for us.  But...SRAM takes twice
as many transistors per bit than DRAM, so that right there makes it
more expensive, also the speed of the memory drives up the prices
in crazy ways as well.  You may think that the DRAM in your computer
is 1 or 2000Mhz, but it is really much much slower, they are just
playing parallel games to allow the bus to be that fast.  So what
does this have to do with caches?  Well the state of the world today
is we have gobs of relatively slow DRAM.  And programs tend to do
a couple of things.  First off obviously programs run sequentially
you run one instruction after another until you hit a branch, so
if you had a way to read a head a little bit of the code you are running
you would have to wait so long for that slow memory.  Another thing
that we/programs do with data other than instrucitons, is we tend
to re-use a variable for some period of time.  We re-use the same
memory address for a while then go onto somewhere else and maybe come
back and mabye not.

So the state of the world is gobs of slow DRAM then we put one or more
layers of caches in front made of faster SRAM but because of the cost
of SRAM they are relatively small but still big enough to store some
instructions and some data that we are actively using.  Just like the
MMU, these caches are inline between us and the rest of the world.
Whenever we perform a read with the cache enabled the cache will see
if it has a copy of our data, if so that is a hit and it returns its
copy of our data.  If it is a miss then it will go get our data plus
some more data after or around our data just in case we are sequentially
working through some memory or accessing various portions of a struct,
etc (or are executing code linearly before hitting a branch).  Now the
cache knows what copies of things it has, and it is very limited in
size relative to the address space.  So obviously it is going to run
out of space.  So before it can go get the thing we are asking for, it
has to make room by evicting something it has.  Before going into that
understand that when we write the cache looks at that as well, sometimes
a write to something causes the cache to go get a copy of that area of
memory and sometimes only reads cause the cache to make a copy.  But
either way if the cache has a copy of that thing in the cache, it will
complete that write by writing to the caches copy, now the cache has a
copy that is newer and different than the outside world.  So now we
have this situation where the cache needs to make room by evicting
somebody.  Caches are designed by different people and they dont all
use the same logic to make this decision, some keep track of the oldest
stuff, some keep track of the oldest stuff, some just use a randomizer
and the unlucky data gets evicted.  The cache knows if the data it has
a copy of has been written to, meaning that its copy is the fresh copy
with new data and the copy out in the world is stale/old and must be
updated before we free up that portion of the cache.  If there have
been no modifications then we really dont have to write that data out,
buf if there are we do.  Now we have a hole, can read the data from
the world and return the one thing the processor asked for.

Am I ever going to get to the point about control over cachable regions?
We understand that the cache keeps a copy of stuff we read so that
if we read it or something right next to it we dont have to go out to
slow memory.  We get an answer for those second and third reads much
faster hoping that overall the one long read of extra data at a slow
speed is balanced by several reads that take very little time to make
it overall faster.  But what if the address we are reading is the
status of something?  It is an address that is managed by maybe us
but also by someone (logic or program) else too?  Like the uart status
that tells us there is room to send another character?  If we read
the uart status, and the cache reads the uart status one time and keeps
a copy (that says the uart is busy) in the cache, and so long as that
doesnt get evicted every time we read that status we get the copy that
says the uart is busy, possibly forever.  Well that wont work.  This
is cache coherence, and has to do with more than one owner of a resource
that is on the far side of one or more caches.  In the case of the
uart that other resource is the uart logic itself.  But in the case
of multiple processors (the arm and the gpu, or in multi-core systems
one core and another).  So we as the manager of the mmu need to be able
to specify whether a region that we map can be cached or not.  There
are signals on the bus on the world side of the mmu that runs into
the processor/mmu side of the cache that tell the cache if a particular
access is cacheable.  Only the ones marked cacheable go through all
of that rambling above, ones marked as not cacheable pass on through
essentially.

And one last cache comment before moving into real stuff.  Instruction
vs data.  When the processor needs to fetch more instructions to
execute it knows those reads are instruction fetches.  Likewise when
our program tells the processor to do a read, the processor knows those
are data reads.  Instruction fetches are always reads, and if we assume
no self modifying code, then the copy in the cache always matches
the copy out in the world.  So we dont have to have an mmu to help
us isolate regions for purposes of cache coherncy with respect to
instruction fetches.  The problem comes with data reads and writes.
So we often have separate instruction cache controls and data cache
controls in the mmu and perhaps in the L1 cache as it can sometimes
treat the two separately.  Here again caches and mmus vary from one
architecture to another (ARM, x86, MIPS, etc).  So we can actually
turn on instruciton caching without the mmu and hope for a performance
improvement.  But we cannot in general turn on a data cache and not
have cache coherency problems with our peripherals, so we need the
mmu for that.  Some designs, some microcontrollers for example, will
be designed such that memory is below some address, and peripherals
and will only cache data accesses below that line, preventing the need
for an MMU for that reason, and being a microcontroller we dont need
the mmu for the other reasons either.

As with all baremetal programming, wading through documentation is
the bulk of the job.  Definitely true here, with the unfortunate
problem that ARM's docs dont all look the same from one Archtectural
Reference Manual to an other.  We have this other problem that we
are techically using an ARMv6 (architecture version 6)(for the raspi 1)
but when you go to ARM's website there is an ARMv5 and then ARMv7 and
ARMv8, but no ARMv6.  Well the ARMv5 manual is actually the original
ARM ARM, that I assume they realized couldnt maintain all the
architecture variations forever in one document, so they perhaps
wisely went to one ARM ARM per rev.  With respect to the MMU, the ARMv5
reference manual covers the ARMv4 (I didnt know there was an mmu option
there) ARMv5 and ARMv6, and there is a mode such that you can have the
same code/tables and it works on all three, meaning you dont have to
if-then-else your code based on whatever architecture you find.  This
raspi 1 example is based on subpages enabled which is this legacy or
compatibility mode across the three.

I am mostly using the ARMv5 Architectural Reference Manual.
ARM DDI0100I.

It should be obvious that we cannot translate ANY virtual address into
ANY physical address 0x12345678 into 0xAABBCCDD for example.  Why not?
Well there are 32 bits, so 4GigaAddresses if it were possible to map
every one of those to any arbitrary other 32 bit address we would need
a 4 GigaWord table or 16 Gigabytes.  First off how would we access
those 16 Gigabytes which is more than we can access on this system and
then have other memory that those translate for also on this system.
It just doesnt fit.  So obviously we have to reduce the problem and
how you do that is you only modify the top address bits and leave the
lower ones the same between virtual and physical.  How many upper
bits gets into the design of the mmu and a balancing game of how
many different things do we want to map.  If we were to only take
the top 4 bits we could re-map 1/16th of the address space, that would
make for a pretty small table to look up the translation, but would
that make any sense?  You couldnt even have 16 different programs
unless you had ram in each of those areas which certainly on the
raspberry pi we dont.  All the ram we have is in the lower 16th.
And we know we cant translate every address to every address so we
have to find some middle ground.  ARM or at least in this legacy mode
initially divides the world up into 1MB sections.  32 bit address space
1MB is 20 bits, 32-20 is 12, or 4096 possible combinations.  To support
1MB pages we would need an mmu table with 4096 entries.  That is
managable.  But maybe there are times when we need to divide one or
more of those 1MB sections up into smaller parts.  And they allow for
that.  We will also look at what they call a small page which is in
units of 4096 bytes.

ARM uses the term Virtual Memory System Architecture or VMSA and
they say things like VMSAv6 to talk about the ARMv6 VMSA.  There
is a section in the ARM ARM titled Virtual Memory System Architecture.
In there we see the coprocessor registers, specifically CP15 register
2 is the translation table base register.

So the ARMv5 ARM ARM (ARM Architectural Reference Manual) is what
we need now.  See the top level README for finding this document,
I have included a few pages in the form of postscript, any decent pdf
viewer should be able to handle these files.  Before the pictures
though, the section in quesiton is titled Virtual Memory System
Architecture.  In the CP15 subsection register 2 is the the translation
table base register.  There are three opcodes which give us access to
three things, TTBR0, TTBR1 and the control register.

First we read this comment

If N = 0 always use TTBR0. When N = 0 (the reset case), the translation
table base is backwards compatible with earlier versions of the
architecture.

That is the one we want, we will leave that as N = 0 and not touch it
and use TTBR0

Now what the TTBR0 description initially is telling me that bit 31
down to 14-n or 14 in our case since n = 0 is the base address, in
PHYSICAL address space.  Note the mmu cannot possibly go through the
mmu to figure out how to go through the mmu, the mmu itself only
operates on physical space and has direct access to it.  In a second
we are going to see that we need the base address for the mmu table
to be aligned to 16384 bytes (when n=0).  (2 to the power 14, the
lower 14 bits of our TLB base address needs to be all zeros).

We write that register using

    mcr p15,0,r0,c2,c0,0 ;@ tlb base

TLB = Translation Lookaside Buffer.  As far as we are concerned think
of it as an array of 32 bit integers, each integer (descriptor) being
used to completely or partially convert from virtual to physical and
describe permissions and caching.

My example is going to have a define called MMUTABLEBASE which will
be where we start our TLB table.

Here is the reality of the world.  Some folks struggle with bit
manipulation, orring and anding and shifting and such, some dont.  The
MMU is logic so it operates on these tables in the way that logic would,
meaning from a programmers perspective it is a lot of bit manipulation
but otherwise is relatively simple to something a program could do.  As
programmers we need to know how the logic uses portions of the virtual
address to look into this descriptor table or TLB, and then extracts
from those bits the next thing it needs to do.  We have to know this so
that for a particular virtual address we can place the descriptor we
want in the place where the hardware is going to find it.  So we need
a few lines of code plus some basic understanding of what is going on.
Just like bit manipulation causes some folks to struggle, reading
a chapter like this mmu chapter is equally daunting.  It is nice to
have someone hold your hand through it.  Hopefully I am doing more
good than bad in that respect.

There is a file, section_translation.ps in this repo, you should be
able to use a pdf viewer to open this file.  The figure on the
second page shows just the address translation from virtual to physical
for a 1MB section.  This picture uses X instead of N, we are using an
N = 0 so that means X = 0.   The translation table base at the top
of the diagram is our MMUTABLEBASE, the address in physical space
of the beginning of our first level TLB or descriptor table.  The
first thing we need to do is find the table entry for the virtual
address in question (the Modified virtual address in this diagram,
as far as we are concerned it is unmodified it is the virtual
address we intend to use).  The first thing we see is the lower
14 bits of the translation table base are SBZ = should be zero.
Basically we need to have the translation table base aligned on a
16Kbyte boundary (2 to the 14th is 16K).  It would not make sense
to use all zeros as the translation table base, we have our reset
and interrupt vectors at and near address zero in the arms address
space so the first sane address would be 0x00004000.  The first
level descriptor is based on the top 12 bits of the virtual address
or 4096 entries, that is 16KBytes (not a coincidence), 0x4000 + 0x4000
is 0x8000, where our arm programs entry point is, so we have space
there if we want to use it.  But any address with the lower 14 bits
being zero will work so long as you have enough memory at that address
and you are not clobbering anything else that is using that memory
space.

So what this picture is showing us is that we take the top 12 bits
of the virtual address, multiply by 4 or shift left 2, and add that
to the translation table base, this gives the address for the first
level descriptor for that virtual address.  The diagram shows the
first level fetch which returns a 32 bit value that we have placed
in the table.  We have to place a descriptor there that tells the
mmu to do what we want.  If the lower 2 bits of that first level
descriptor are 0b10 then this is a 1MB Section.  If a 1MB section
then the top 12 bits of the first level descriptor replace the top
12 bits of the virtual address to convert it into a physical address.
Understand here first and foremost so long as we do the N = 0 thing,
the first level descriptor or the first thing the mmu does is look at
the top 12 bits of the virtual address, always.  If the lower two bits
of the first level descriptor are not 0b10 then we get into
a second level descriptor and more virtual bits come into play, but
for now if we start by learning just 1MB sections, the conversion
from virtual to physical only cares about the top 12 bits of the
address.  So for 1MB sections we dont have to concentrate on every
actual address we are going to access we only need to think about
the 1MB aligned ranges.  The uart for example on the raspi 1 has
a number of registers that start with 0x202150xx, if we use a 1MB
section for those we only care about the 0x202xxxxx part of the
address.  To not have to change our code we would want to have
the virtual = physical for that and mark it as not cacheable.

So if my MMUTABLEBASE was 0x00004000 and I had a virtual address of
0x12345678 then the hardware is going to take the top 12 bits of that
address 0x123, multiply by 4 and add that to the MMUTABLEBASE.
0x4000+(0x123<<2) = 0x0000448C.  And that is the address the mmu is
going to use for the first-level lookup.  Ignoring the other bits in
the descriptor for now, if the first-level descriptor has the value
0xABC00002, the lower two bits are 0x10, a 1MB section, so the top
12 bits replace the virtual addresses top 12 bits and our 0x12345678
is converted to the physical address 0xABC45678.

Now they have this optional thing called a supersection which is a 16MB
sized thing rather than 1MB and one might think that that would make
life easier, right?  Wrong.  No matter what, assuming the N = 0 thing
the first level descriptor is found using the top 12 bits of the
virtual address, so in order to do some 16MB thing you need 16 entries
one for each of the possible 1MB sections.  If you are already
generating 16 descriptors anyway, you might as well just make them 1MB
sections, you can read up on the differences between super sections and
sections and try them if you want.  For what I am doing here dont need
them, just wanted to point out you still need 16 entries per super
section.

Hopefully I have not lost you yet with this address manipulation,
and maybe you are one step ahead of me, yes EVERY fetch, load or store
with the mmu enabled requires at least one mmu table lookup, the mmu
when it accesses this memory does not go through itself, but EVERY
other fetch and load and store.  Which does have a performance hit,
they do have a bit of a cache in the mmu to store the last so many tlb
lookups.  That helps, but you cannot avoid the mmu having to do the
conversion on every address.

In the ARM ARM I am looking at the subsection on first-level
descriptors has a table:

Table B4-1 First-level descriptor format (VMSAv6, subpages enabled)

What this is telling us is that if the first-level descriptor, the
32 bit number we place in the right place in the TLB, has the lower
two bits 0b10 then that entry defines a 1MB section and the mmu can get
everything it needs from that first level descriptor.  But if the
lower two bits are 0b01 then this is a coarse page table entry and
we have to go to a second level descriptor to complete the
conversion from virtual to physical.  Not every address will need
this only the address ranges we want to be more coarsely divided than
1MB.  Or the other way of saying it is of we want to control an
address range in chunks smaller than 1MB then we need to use pages
not sections.  You can certainly use pages for the whole world, but
if you do the math, 4096Byte pages would mean your mmu table needs
to be 4MB+16K worst case.  And you have to do more work to set that
all up.

The coarse_translation.ps file I have included in this repo starts
off the same way as a section, it has to, the logic doesnt know what
you want until it sees the first level descriptor.  If it sees a
0b01 as the lower 2 bits of the first level descriptor then this is
a coarse page table entry and it needs to do a second level fetch.
The second level fetch does not use the mmu tlb table base address
bits 31:10 of the second level address plus bits 19:12 of the
virtual address (times 4) are where the second level descriptor lives.
Note that is 8 more bits so the section is divided into 256 parts, this
page table address is similar to the mmu table address, but it needs
to be aligned on a 1K boundry (lower 10 bits zeros) and can be worst
case 1KBytes in size.

The second level descriptor format defined in the ARM ARM (small pages
are most interesting here, subpages enabled) is a little different
than a first level section, we had a domain in the first level
descriptor to get here, but now have direct access to four sets of
AP bits you/I would have to read more to know what the difference
is between the domain defined AP and these additional four, for now
I dont care this is bare metal, set them to full access (0b11) and
move on (see below about domain and ap bits).

So lets take the virtual address 0x12345678 and the MMUTABLEBASE of
0x4000 again.  The first level descriptor address is the top three
bits of the virtual address 0x123, times 4, added to the MMUTABLEBASE
0x448C.  But this time when we look it up we find a value in the
table that has the lower two bits being 0b01.  Just to be crazy lets
say that descriptor was 0xABCDE001  (ignoring the domain and other
bits just talking address right now).  That means we take 0xABCDE000
the picture shows bits 19:12 (0x45) of the virtual address (0x12345678)
so the address to the second level descriptor in this crazy case is
0xABCDE000+(0x45<<2) = 0xABCDE114  why is that crazy?  because I
chose an address where we in theory dont have ram on the raspberry pi
maybe a mirrored address space, but a sane address would have been
somewhere close to the MMUTABLEBASE so we can keep the whole of the
mmu tables in a confined area.  Used this address simply for
demonstration purposes not based on a workable solution.

The "other" bits in the descriptors are the domain, the TEX bits,
the C and B bits, domain and AP.

The C bit is the simplest one to start with that means Cacheable.  For
peripherals we absolutely dont want them to be cached.  For ram, maybe.

The b bit, means bufferable, as in write buffer.  Something you may
not have heard about or thought about ever.  It is kind of like a cache
on the write end of things instead of read end.   I digress, when
a processor writes something everything is known, the address and
data.  So just like when you give a letter to the post(wo)man as
far as you are concerned you are done, you dont need to wait for it
to actually make it all the way to its destination.  You can go on with
your day.  Likewise if you have 10 letters to send, if you keep going
with this though you could fill up the mail truck then you would have
to wait for another and then you could go on with your day.  A write
buffer is the same deal.  For reads we have to wait for an answer so it
doesnt work the same way but writes we have this option.  Why not use
it all the time?  Well we dont have control over it, the writes happen
at some unknown to us time in the future, we can possibly get into a
cache coherency like problem of assuming something was written when
it wasnt.

Now the TEX bits you just have to look up and there is the rub, there
are likely more than one set of tables for TEX C and B, I am going
to stick with a TEX of 0b000 and not mess with any fancy features
there.  Now depending on whether this is considered an older arm
(ARMv5) or an ARMv6 or newer the combination of TEX, C and B have
some subtle differences.  The cache bit in particular does enable
or disable this space as cacheable.  That simply asserts bits on
the AMDA/AXI (memory) bus that marks the transaction as cacheable,
you still need a cache and need it setup and enabled for the
transaction to actually get cached.  If you dont have the cache for
that transaction type enabled then it just does a normal memory (or
peripheral) operation.  So we set TEX to zeros to keep it out of the
way.

Lastly the domain and AP bits.  Now you will see a 4 bit domain thing
and a 2 bit domain thing.  These are related.  There is a register in
the MMU right next to the translation table base address register this
one is a 32 bit register that contains 16 different domain definitions.

The two bit domain controls are defined as such (these are AP bits)

0b00 No access Any access generates a domain fault
0b01 Client Accesses are checked against the access permission bits in the TLB entry
0b10 Reserved Using this value has UNPREDICTABLE results
0b11 Manager Accesses are not checked against the access permission bits in the TLB
entry, so a permission fault cannot be generated

For starters we are going to set all of the domains to 0b11 dont check
cant fault.  What are these 16 domains though?  Notice it takes 4 bits
to describe one of 16 things.  The different domains have no specific
meaning other than that we can have 16 different definitions that we
control for whatever reason.  You might allow for 16 different
threads running at once in your operating system, or 16 different
types of software running (kernel, application, ...) you can mark
a bunch of sections as belonging to one parituclar domain, and with a
simple change to that domain control register, a whole domain might
go from one type of permission to another, from no checking to
no access for example.  By just writing this domain register you can
quickly change what address spaces have permission and which ones dont
without necessarily changing the mmu table.

Since I usually use the MMU in bare metal to enable data caching on ram
I set my domain controls to 0b11, no checking and I simply make all
the MMU sections domain number 0.

So we end up with this simple function that allows us to add first level
descriptors in the MMU translation table.

unsigned int mmu_section ( unsigned int vadd, unsigned int padd, unsigned int flags )
{
    unsigned int ra;
    unsigned int rb;
    unsigned int rc;

    ra=vadd>>20;
    rb=MMUTABLEBASE|(ra<<2);
    ra=padd>>20;
    rc=(ra<<20)|flags|2;
    PUT32(rb,rc);
    return(0);
}

So what you have to do to turn on the MMU is to first figure out all
the memory you are going to access, and make sure you have entries
for that.  This is important, if you forget something, and dont have
a valid entry there, then you fault, your fault handler, if you have
chosen to write one, and it may also fault.

So the smallest amount of ram on a raspi is 256MB or 0x10000000 bytes.

Our program enters at address 0x8000, so that is within the first
section 0x000xxxxx so we should make that section cacheable and
bufferable.

    mmu_section(0x00000000,0x00000000,0x0000|8|4);

This is saying map the virtual 0x000xxxxx to the physical 0x000xxxxx
enable the cache and write buffer. 0x8 is the C bit and 0x4 is the B
bit.  tex, domain, etc are zeros.

If we want to use all 256mb we would need to do this for all the
sections from 0x000xxxxx to 0x100xxxxx.  Actually I changed the code
and the first thing it does is map everything virtual = physical with
no caching.

We know that for the pi1 the peripherals, uart and such are in ARM
physical space at 0x20xxxxxx.  So we either need 16 1MB section sized
entries to cover that whole range or we look at specific sections for
specific things we care to talk to and just add those.  The uart and
the gpio it is associated with is in the 0x202xxxxx space.  There are
a couple of timers in the 0x200xxxxx space so one entry can cover those.

if we didnt want to allow those to be cached or write buffered then

    mmu_section(0x20000000,0x20000000,0x0000); //NOT CACHED!
    mmu_section(0x20200000,0x20200000,0x0000); //NOT CACHED!

(yes we already did this when we had a loop map the whole world)

Now you have to think on a system level here, there are a number
of things in play.  We need to plan our memory space, where are we
putting the MMU table, where are our peripherals, where is our program.

If the only reason for using the mmu is to allow the use of the d cache
then just map the whole world virtual = physical if you want with the
peripherals not cached and the rest cached.

So once our tables are setup then we need to actually turn the
MMU on.  Now I cant figure out where I got this from, and I have
modified it in this repo.  According to this manual it was with the
ARMv6 that we got the DSB feature which says wait for either cache
or MMU to finish something before continuing.  In particular when
initializing a cache to start it up you want to clean out all the
entries in a safe way you dont want to evict them and hose memory
you want to invalidate everything, mark it such that the cache lines
are empty/available by throwing away what was there, not saving it.
Likewise that little bit of TLB caching the MMU has, we want to
invalidate that too so we dont start up the mmu with entries in there
that dont match our entries.

Why are we invalidating the cache in mmu init code?  Because first we
need the mmu to use the d cache (to protect the peripherals from
being cached) and second the controls that enable the mmu are in the
same register as the i and d controls so it made sense to do both
mmu and cache stuff in one function.

So after the DSB we set our domain control bits, now in this example
I have done something different, 15 of the 16 domains have the 0b11
setting which is dont fault on anything, manager mode.  I set domain
1 such that it has no access, so in the example I will change one
of the descriptor table entries to use domain one, then I will access
it and then see the access violation.  I am also programming both
translation table base addresses even though we are using the N = 0
mode and only one is needed.  Depends on which manual you read I guess
as to whether or not you see the N = 0 and the separate or shared
i and d mmu tables.  (the reason for two registers is if you want your
i and d address spaces to be managed separately).

Understand I have been running on ARMv6 systems without the DSB and it
just works, so maybe that was dumb luck...

This code relies on the caller to pass in the MMU enable and I and D
cache enables.  This is because this is derived from code where
sometimes I turn things on or dont turn things on and wanted it
generic.

.globl start_MMU
start_MMU:
    mov r2,#0
    mcr p15,0,r2,c7,c7,0 ;@ invalidate caches
    mcr p15,0,r2,c8,c7,0 ;@ invalidate tlb
    mcr p15,0,r2,c7,c10,4 ;@ DSB ??

    mvn r2,#0
    bic r2,#0xC
    mcr p15,0,r2,c3,c0,0 ;@ domain

    mcr p15,0,r0,c2,c0,0 ;@ tlb base
    mcr p15,0,r0,c2,c0,1 ;@ tlb base

    mrc p15,0,r2,c1,c0,0
    orr r2,r2,r1
    mcr p15,0,r2,c1,c0,0

    bx lr

I am going to mess with the translation tables after the MMU is started
so the easiest way to deal with the TLB cache is to invalidate it, but
dont need to mess with main L1 cache.  ARMv6 introduces a feature to
help with this, but going with this solution.

.globl invalidate_tlbs
invalidate_tlbs:
    mov r2,#0
    mcr p15,0,r2,c8,c7,0  ;@ invalidate tlb
    mcr p15,0,r2,c7,c10,4 ;@ DSB ??
    bx lr

Something to note here.  Debugging using the JTAG based on chip debugger
makes life easier, that removing sd cards or the old days pulling an
eeprom out and putting it it in an eraser then a programmer.  BUT,
it is not completely without issue.  When and where and if you hit this
depends heavily on the core you are using and the jtag tools and the
commands you remember/prefer.  This is a basic cache coherency problem
in a self modifying code kind of way.  When we use the jtag debugger
to write instructions to memory the debugger uses the ARM bus and does
a data write, which does not go through the instruction cache.  So if
there is an instruction at address 0xD000 in the instruction cache when
we stopped the ARM, and we write a new instruction from our new program
to address 0xD000, when we start the ARM again if that 0xD000 doesnt
get invalidated to make room for other instructions by the time we get
to it, it will execute the old stale instrucion from one or more
programs we ran in the past.  Randomly mixing instructions from
different programs just doesnt work.  Again some of the debuggers and/or
cores will disable caching when you use jtag, but some like this
ARM11 may not, and this becomes a very real problem if you dont deal
with it in some way (never I cache, never use the jtag debugger if
using the I cache, see if your tools can disable the I cache before
running the next program, etc).  You also have to be aware of if the
I and D caches are shared, and if so does that help you or not.  Read
your docs.

So the example is going to start with the mmu off and write to
addresses in four different 1MB address spaces.  So that later we
can play with the section descriptors and demonstrate virtual to
physical address conversion.

So write some stuff and print it out on the uart.

    PUT32(0x00045678,0x00045678);
    PUT32(0x00145678,0x00145678);
    PUT32(0x00245678,0x00245678);
    PUT32(0x00345678,0x00345678);

    hexstring(GET32(0x00045678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00145678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00245678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00345678));
    uart_send(0x0D); uart_send(0x0A);

then setup the mmu with at least those four sections and the peripherals

    mmu_section(0x00000000,0x00000000,0x0000|8|4);
    mmu_section(0x00100000,0x00100000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00200000,0x00200000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00300000,0x00300000,0x0000);
    //peripherals
    mmu_section(0x20000000,0x20000000,0x0000); //NOT CACHED!
    mmu_section(0x20200000,0x20200000,0x0000); //NOT CACHED!

actually the example now loops through the whole address space then
does the two peripheral lines even though they are redundant.

and start the mmu with the I and D caches enabled

    start_mmu(MMUTABLEBASE,0x00000001|0x1000|0x0004);

then if we read those four addresses again we get the same output
as before since we maped virtual = physical.

    hexstring(GET32(0x00045678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00145678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00245678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00345678));
    uart_send(0x0D); uart_send(0x0A);

but what if we swizzle things around.  make virtual 0x001xxxxx =
physical 0x003xxxxx.  0x002 looks at 0x000 and 0x003 looks at 0x001
(dont mess with the 0x00000000 section, that is where our program is
running)

    mmu_section(0x00100000,0x00300000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00200000,0x00000000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00300000,0x00100000,0x0000);

and maybe we dont need to do this but do it anyway just in case

    invalidate_tlbs();

read them again.

    hexstring(GET32(0x00045678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00145678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00245678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00345678));
    uart_send(0x0D); uart_send(0x0A);

the 0x000xxxxx entry was not modifed so we get 000045678 as the output
but the 0x001xxxxx read is now coming from physical 0x003xxxxx so we
get the 00345678 output, 0x002xxxxx comes from the 0x000xxxxx space
so that read gives 00045678 and the 0x003xxxxx is mapped to 0x001xxxxx
physical giving 00145678 as the output.

So up to this point the output looks like this.

DEADBEEF
00045678
00145678
00245678
00345678

00045678
00145678
00245678
00345678

00045678
00345678
00045678
00145678

first blob is without the mmu enabled, second with the mmu but
virtual = physical, third we use the mmu to show virtual != physical
for some ranges.

Now for some small pages, I made this function to help out, note that
it sets up both the first and second level descriptor.

unsigned int mmu_small ( unsigned int vadd, unsigned int padd, unsigned int flags, unsigned int mmubase )
{
    unsigned int ra;
    unsigned int rb;
    unsigned int rc;

    ra=vadd>>20;
    rb=MMUTABLEBASE|(ra<<2);
    rc=(mmubase&0xFFFFFC00)/*|(domain<<5)*/|1;
    //hexstrings(rb); hexstring(rc);
    PUT32(rb,rc); //first level descriptor
    ra=(vadd>>12)&0xFF;
    rb=(mmubase&0xFFFFFC00)|(ra<<2);
    rc=(padd&0xFFFFF000)|(0xFF0)|flags|2;
    //hexstrings(rb); hexstring(rc);
    PUT32(rb,rc); //second level descriptor
    return(0);
}

So before turning on the mmu some physical addresses were written
with some data.  The function takes the virtual, physical, flags and
where you want the secondary table to be.  Remember secondary tables
can be up to 1K in size and are aligned on a 1K boundary.

    mmu_small(0x0AA45000,0x00145000,0,0x00000400);
    mmu_small(0x0BB45000,0x00245000,0,0x00000800);
    mmu_small(0x0CC45000,0x00345000,0,0x00000C00);
    mmu_small(0x0DD45000,0x00345000,0,0x00001000);
    mmu_small(0x0DD46000,0x00146000,0,0x00001000);
    //put these back
    mmu_section(0x00100000,0x00100000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00200000,0x00200000,0x0000);
    mmu_section(0x00300000,0x00300000,0x0000);
    invalidate_tlbs();

Now why did I use different secondary table addresses most of the
time but not all of the time?  All accesses go through the first level
descriptor before determining if they need a second.  In order for
two small page entries to work they have to have the same first level
descriptor, and thus have to live in the same secondary table, so if
you use this function with addresses whose top 12 bits match, their
secondary table addresses have to match.  And unless you think through
a safe way to do it, if the upper 12 bits dont match then just use a
different secondary table address.

If you were to do this instead

    mmu_small(0x0DD45000,0x00345000,0,0x00001000);
    mmu_small(0x0DD46000,0x00146000,0,0x00001400);

That would be a bug, because the first line would have its secondary
entry based on 0x1000, the second line would write the first level to
point both of them at 0x1400, set its second level based on 0x1400 and
now that first line's entry is not going to be used, it gets whatever
it finds in the 0x1400 table.

So this basically points some small pages at the memory we setup
in the beginning.  Those last two small page entries demonstrating
that we have separated from a section and now see small pages.

The last example is just demonstrating an access violation.  Changing
the domain to that one domain we did not set full access to

    //access violation.

    mmu_section(0x00100000,0x00100000,0x0020);
    invalidate_tlbs();

    hexstring(GET32(0x00045678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00145678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00245678));
    hexstring(GET32(0x00345678));
    uart_send(0x0D); uart_send(0x0A);

The first 0x45678 read comes from that first level descriptor, with
that domain

00045678
00000010

How do I know what that means with that output.  Well from my blinker05
example we touched on exceptions (interrupts).  I made a generic test
fixture such that anything other than a reset prints something out
and then hangs.   In no way shape or form is this a complete handler
but what it does show is that it is the exception that is at address
0x00000010 that gets hit which is data abort.  So figuring out it was
a data abort (pretty much expected) have that then read the data fault
status registers, being a data access we expect the data/combined one
to show somthing and the instruction one to not.  Adding that
instrumentation resulted in.

00045678
00000010
00000019
00000000
00008110
E5900000
00145678

Now I switched to the ARM1176JZF-S Technical Reference Manual for more
detail and that shows the 0x01 was domain 1, the domain we used for
that access. then the 0x9 means Domain Section Fault.

The lr during the abort shows us the instruction, which you would need
to disassemble to figure out the address, or at least that is one
way to do it perhaps there is a status register for that.

The instruction and the address match our expectations for this fault.

This is simply a basic intro.  Just enough to be dangerous.  The MMU
is one of the simplest peripherals to program so long as bit
manipulation is not something that causes you to lose sleep.  What makes
it hard is that if you mess up even one bit, or forget even one thing
you can crash in spectacular ways (often silently without any way of
knowing what happened).  Debugging can be hard at best.

The ARM ARM indicates that the ARMv6 adds the feature of separating
the I and D from an mmu perspective which is an interesting thought
(see the jtag debugging comments, and think about how this can affect
you re-loading a program into ram and running) you have enough ammo
to try that.
